# drake on the calc

This is a small TI-84 Plus CE calculator program made to show the common drake meme template as a program.

it is not very versatile and it only shows that one caption unless otherwise edited.

## license

This software has NO license and is completely free to use

## installation

I don't recommend installing this software because it basically just takes up space on a calculator but below are instructions

1. Download the `bin/DRAKE.8xp` file
2. Open `TI Connect CE`
3. Upload file to calculator filesystem
